Focus
=====

##Purpose

My mind wanders a lot. So I thought I'd write a game that's intentionally
boring. It gets more boring the longer I play. The hope is I'll get better at
focusing my attention.

This also uses python patterns I haven't had reason to touch before.
Learning.

##Mechanics

All you do is wait for a `*` to show up within a field of other characters.
When you see it, hit space. The spacing between `*` events is random, but can
get really long if you play long enough. The field of characters alternates
color so you don't get bad afterimages.

##Future

There is a lot that can be improved, but this pretty much does what I want it
to do. The only thing I plan to work on is the pattern for increasing the
spacing between `*` events.
